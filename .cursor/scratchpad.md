# Multi-Agent Coordinator Scratchpad

## Background and Motivation

This repository implements a multi-agent system coordinator for a Micro SAAS Learning Profile platform. The system operates with two distinct roles:

- **Planner**: High-level analysis, task breakdown, success criteria definition, and progress evaluation
- **Executor**: Implementation of specific tasks, code writing, testing, and progress reporting

### Current Request (2025-08-14)
**User Goal**: Create comprehensive user flows and product architecture for flexible child profile system

**Specific Requirements**:
1. Document key user flows for parent sign-up and parent-focused quiz (beginlearning.com parent resource center)
2. Document teacher sign-up flow
3. Document teacher-invites-parent flow with quiz completion
4. Design flexible input/output system while maintaining single dynamic child profile
5. Account for different question sets based on user context (teacher vs parent use cases)

### **CLARIFICATION REQUEST (2025-08-14)**
**Critical Architecture Questions**:
1. **Multiple Quiz Support**: Does the architecture support completely separate quiz sets (parent questions vs teacher questions) rather than just context variations?
2. **Progressive Profile Building**: Can the single profile be updated/enhanced as additional quizzes are completed?
3. **Different Question Orders**: Can parents and teachers get entirely different question sequences while contributing to same profile?
4. **Adaptive Results Pages**: Can results pages dynamically show teacher-specific vs parent-specific content while sharing underlying components?
5. **Component Reusability**: How to structure shared components that render differently based on user context?

### **6Cs INTEGRATION ANALYSIS REQUEST (2025-08-14)**
**Current System Analysis Needed**:
1. **Existing Question Mapping**: How do current questions map to the 6Cs framework?
2. **Quiz Type Distribution**: Which 6Cs can be assessed by parents vs teachers vs both?
3. **Question Pool Integration**: How to integrate existing questions into parent/teacher quiz types?
4. **6Cs Scoring Consistency**: Ensure 6Cs scoring works across multiple quiz types
5. **Framework Preservation**: Maintain 6Cs integrity while enabling flexible quiz types

### **CLP 2.0 COMPLIANCE ANALYSIS REQUEST (2025-08-14)**
**Requirements from CLP 2.0 Description**:
1. **24-Question Structure**: Current ~26 questions need to be optimized to 24 questions per CLP 2.0 spec
2. **Age-Specific Questions**: 3 age groups (3-4, 4-5, 5+) with different question sets per CLP requirements
3. **Scoring Framework**: 3 questions per skill, 1 point/0.5 point/0 point scoring system (different from current 1-5 scale)
4. **Skills Measured**: 6Cs + Literacy + Math (8 skills total = 24 questions)
5. **Learning Preferences**: 4 preference questions (Engagement, Modality, Social, Interests)
6. **Teacher Use Case**: Last 4-5 questions should be teacher-relevant for classroom assessment
7. **Parent-Teacher Distinction**: Parent quiz for home behavior vs Teacher quiz for classroom behavior

### **ENHANCED AGE SELECTION REQUIREMENTS (2025-08-14)**
**New Precise Age Selection System**:
1. **Parent Age Input**: Allow parents to select specific age (month, year) for their child
2. **Exact Age Questions**: Use specific questions from 3-year-old.html, 5-year-old.html based on exact age
3. **Dynamic Age Routing**: Route to appropriate question set based on precise age input
4. **Extended Age Support**: Ensure quiz functions for ages above 5 (6, 7, 8+ years)
5. **Age-Appropriate Content**: Questions scale appropriately for older children while maintaining CLP 2.0 structure
6. **Developmental Accuracy**: Question complexity matches child's developmental stage precisely

### User Specified Lessons
- Include info useful for debugging in the program output
- Read the file before you try to edit it
- If there are vulnerabilities that appear in the terminal, run npm audit before proceeding

### Technical Lessons
- .cursor directory is standard location for development coordination files
- Scratchpad.md serves as central communication hub between roles
- Task breakdown should include clear success criteria for validation

## Role-Specific Guidelines

### When Acting as Planner
- Perform high-level analysis and break down tasks into smallest possible units
- Define clear success criteria for each task
- Update "Background and Motivation" and "Key Challenges and Analysis" sections
- Focus on simplest, most efficient approaches (no over-engineering)
- Record all planning results in structured sections

### When Acting as Executor  
- Execute one task at a time from "Project Status Board"
- Report progress after completing milestones or hitting blockers
- Update "Current Status / Progress Tracking" and "Executor's Feedback" sections
- Follow TDD practices - write tests before implementation
- Test each functionality thoroughly before moving to next task
- Document solutions to bugs/errors in "Lessons" section

### Communication Protocol
- Human user must specify Planner or Executor mode for each new request
- Executor completes one task then asks user to test manually before marking complete
- Only Planner announces overall task completion, not Executor
- Avoid rewriting entire document - append new information
- Never delete records from other roles - mark as outdated if needed

### Security & Best Practices
- Always follow security best practices
- Never introduce code that exposes/logs secrets or keys
- Never commit secrets or keys to repository
- Assist with defensive security tasks only
- Refuse malicious code creation/modification
