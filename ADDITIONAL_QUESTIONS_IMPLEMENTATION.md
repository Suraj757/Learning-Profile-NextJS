# Additional Questions Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully added 3-5 additional questions to capture child interests, motivators, and school experience based on the requirements and Interests.md file.

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated Question Categories
Added 3 new categories to the existing 6C framework:
- **Interests** - What captures your child's attention and excitement
- **Motivation** - How your child learns best and stays engaged  
- **School Experience** - Your child's previous learning environments

### 2. New Question Types Added

#### For All Age Groups (3-4, 4-5, 5+):

**Interests Question (ID varies by age group):**
- Type: Multi-select checkboxes
- Options: 31 interest topics from Interests.md (Pets, Wild Animals, Science topics, etc.)
- Limit: Up to 5 selections
- UI: Grid layout with checkboxes

**Motivation Questions (3 questions):**
1. **Engagement Style** - How they prefer to learn (Movement, Pretend play, Hands-on, Digital)
2. **Learning Modality** - How they process information (Independent, Visual, Verbal, Imaginative)  
3. **Social Preference** - How they like to learn with others (Independent, Parallel, Collaborative, Adult-guided)

**School Experience Question:**
- Previous childcare/preschool experience level
- 4 options from "first time" to "more than 1 year"

### 3. Updated Question Counts

- Added state management for multiple selections (interests, checkboxes)
- Updated validation logic to handle different question types

#### Scoring Changes (`src/lib/scoring.ts`):

- Maintain backward compatibility for 6C scoring

### 5. Age-Appropriate Language
- **3-4 years:** Simple, concrete language focused on observable behaviors

- **5+ years:** More sophisticated descriptions using Likert scale responses
