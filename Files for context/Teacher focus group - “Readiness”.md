Teacher focus group \- “Readiness”  
August 1, 2025

Rebecca (Preschool), Cassie (Preschool and Pre-K, admin \+ subbing and enrichment classes), Emily (micro-school, K-2nd grade), Jamie (K and 2nd), Brittany (2nd)

First week of school:

* Exciting but also very stressful  
* Chaos  
* Exciting (love the chaos)  
* Fresh, newness (clothes, classroom, kids), exhausting  
* Exhausting and goes by in the blink of an eye

Start of the year experiences:  
Biggest challenges/stressors:

* R \- a lot of meetings, checklists, admin tasks that get in the way of planning, lesson planning, prep. Breaks flow  
* E \- getting back into the swing of things; K kids to learn classroom routines, rules of the classroom, classroom management and protocols  
  * Mental load of remembering every little detail of what kids need to learn to be successful in the classroom  
* C \- managing expectations both in the classroom (kids) and with the parents (trust)  
  * Managing parents is a lot; they’re following protocols and read the parent handbook so it trickles down to the kids; they want so much communication, pictures, updates, etc. but also give teachers space to focus on the kids and not on taking pictures and answering parent emails; building trust  
* J \- every class is so different; depends on group dynamics, kids’ readiness, etc.   
  * Every day you need to re-evaluate what’s going to make tomorrow effective  
  * Mental load  
* B \- depends on the group of kids

Wish you knew about your students:

* E \- excitingly engage the students; find their motivators and what they’re interested in (not just learning styles); get them invested and on board; build relationships  
* R \- have they been in school before? Helps me manage my expectations  
* C \- we do a lot of intake ahead of the start of the year; family book so we have a visual of the family members, other caregivers, etc.  
* J \- parent goals (e.g., build social relationships with peers)  
  * I want to know everything about them; what they did that summer, where they come from, etc.

Magic wand to make the beginning of the school year easier:

* J \- social emotional needs of the students; motivation/buy-in  
* C \- “who” is their child \- are they the observer? But sometimes parents don’t know for sure and kids act differently at school and home  
  * A glimpse into their truest personality  
* R \- sometimes parents don’t want to share some information about their kids and take a wait-and-see approach  
* B \- talk  to previous teachers (1st grade) to get a glimpse into academics and behaviors for each child  
  * Spreadsheet (google docs) for tips for success, academic and behavioral issues, etc.

Ways you learn about kids coming into the classroom:

* R \- in person meetings, intro, forms, “all about me” unit to start the school year (creating an online book \+ presentation)  
* C \- “sneak a peek” day for families to see the classroom and meet the teachers; PD days for teachers to share info with each other  
* J \- K orientation in the Spring of the previous year, BTS night open house, first two days are used for one-on-one meetings (can they count to 10?) which used to be state mandated testing; use physical cards to sort kids into classes for the following year (taking into account strengths, friendship dynamics, etc.)

Are your students ready for their first day?

* B \- some kids are ready and some aren’t ready for the new grade; a lot of tears; unsure and don’t know what to expect  
  * Send out message on class dojo  
  * Have to really reassure them it’s ok and you’re on the journey together  
* R \- 4-year-olds; many haven’t been in school before; don’t know what to expect; separation anxiety  
* C \- 50-50; kids who had done part-time intro program knew what to do (line up go to the sandbox), kids who hadn’t tried to run away; were disoriented and didn’t know what the expectations were; how helpful just a little bit of time could help so much  
* E \- all different backgrounds (homeschool, public school); any kind of organized learning experience helps; even if the routines are different, it helps compared to those with no experience


What does “ready” mean to you?

* R \- able to attend/pay attention for at least 5-10 minutes; able to transition from one activity to another; follow simple directions; communicate their needs to me (e.g., go potty)  
  * Some kids cry in the corner but they can’t communicate their needs/feelings  
* E \- mentally being ready; not being overwhelmed with fear; able to be present  
* C \- readiness changes depending on the age. For pre-K kids, it’s ability to advocate for themselves, enough communication to express needs and asks questions; for 2-year-olds it just means they got there  
* B \- ready to learn; it’s a hard question; ready to learn the rules and transitions of the classroom; use the materials; ready for 2nd grade material; ready for new friendships

Does “school ready” mean something different than “ready”?

* J \- ready to engage appropriately  
  * They’ll show up as they show up and our job is to help move them from A to B, but if they’re not ready to engage in the process of learning, it makes it really difficult  
* C \- triggers for me “K Readiness” \- what do we really mean by that? The social-emotional aspect is the most important part  
  * Holding scissors is great but not school readiness. The “readiness” standards can be a stressor. We need to define what’s actually important for entering a classroom. They don’t need to write their address. They have to be willing and open and ready to learn

Do you feel the skills we’re teaching today, with the world changing so quickly, will prepare them for the future?

* J \- I agree; state of Utah project and place-based learning  to develop inquiry and self-efficacy; better preparing students for the future  
* E \- Arizona which is why I’m in a micro-school; it’s about teaching to the test and pushing through; not much outside out of specific academics; teachers are complaining that kids aren’t ready but kids are being pushed through anyway  
  * Academic standards but with real life skills because it’s been missing in Arizona  
    

Playbook \- success is doing well in school, go to college, get a career, you’ll do well in life. Do you think that’s still the playbook for the future?

* E \- it may still work for some. Many career paths, not just one playbook; explore other ways of learning and other life and career paths  
* J \- the playbook needs to be expanded  
  * Success is about building self-efficacy and seeing yourself as a lifelong learner  
  * Accomplish what you set out to do  
  * Must have life skills

Parents aren’t sure how to prepare kids for an uncertain future. How are we helping them?

* J \- your child is the future. We’ll give them the skills to navigate the issues and problems; we can teach kids the skills they need   
  * Kids get to determine the future  
  * Includes educating parents who did not receive these life skills themselves; build parents’ confidence and competence  
* E \- lifelong learning; that is everything  
  * Empowerment and want to learn  
  * Growth mindset  
  * Confidence
