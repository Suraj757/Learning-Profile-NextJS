**Use Cases**

Parents fill out an assessment in order to receive:

In just 5–7 minutes, parents complete a short but powerful questionnaire designed by early childhood experts. The result is a personalized learning profile that gives a whole-child view of their child’s strengths, preferences, and growth areas — going far beyond typical academic reports.

#### **1\. A Personalized Activity Set *(Primary Benefit)***

*“Get a personalized set of expert-designed learning activities tailored to your child’s strengths — in just 5 minutes.”*

Parents receive a personalized activity set based on their child’s skill levels and learning preferences. This includes:

* 5 printable activities designed for their age and skill profile

* 3 easy, everyday learning ideas parents can use at home

* 3 creative project ideas with short how-to instructions

* 2 curated blog articles to help parents understand and support their child’s learning style

These activities support both strong and developing areas, using fun, engaging strategies that fit how their child learns best (e.g., hands-on, imaginative, movement-based, etc.).

#### **2\. Their Child’s Learning Profile**

Every child is given a learning profile:

* **Archetype Name & Summary**  
  A relatable and engaging description of how their child tends to approach learning and play (e.g., “The Imaginative Explorer” or “The Focused Builder”).

* **Top Strength Areas**  
  Clear identification of which skills their child demonstrates consistently, such as confidence, creativity, or literacy.

* **Key Growth Areas**  
  Insight into areas where the child may need more support or exposure, presented with compassion and developmental sensitivity.

* **Learning Preferences**  
  Highlights of how their child best engages with new ideas, including:

  * **Engagement style** (e.g., movement-based, pretend play, hands-on)

  * **Modality** (e.g., visual, verbal, imaginative, independent)

  * **Social preferences** (e.g., cooperative, parallel, adult-guided)

Together, these components empower parents to better understand and support their child’s development — and to feel confident that their child is growing across academic, social, and emotional domains.

Teachers send the assessment to parents in order to: 

#### **1\. Get to Know Students at the Start of the Year**

Teachers can use this tool at the beginning of the school year to gain deeper insight into each student’s unique learning profile — including their strengths, growth areas, and learning preferences. This gives teachers a head start on understanding who their learners are beyond basic academic measures. When parents complete the assessment before the school year starts, it helps build a bridge between home and school learning from day one.

#### **2\. Use as a Holistic Progress Assessment**

Teachers can complete the same assessment mid-year and again at the end of the school year to reflect on student growth across a broad set of skills that traditional academic assessments often overlook. This provides a richer narrative for student development and offers a powerful way to re-engage families during parent-teacher conferences.

By comparing results from different time points, teachers can:

* Track individual growth in specific 6Cs and academic content areas (literacy and math).

* Adjust classroom support and enrichment based on updated skill profiles.

* Share holistic, child-centered progress with families.

This helps educators nurture the “whole child” and advocate for personalized instruction that honors both academic and social-emotional development.

**Assessment Specs**

* [Link to assessment questions](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1fSeGFmplVtm0eWlEengD7z19yyKQ2bma/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=116242708843040738211&rtpof=true&sd=true)  
* Parents fill out a different assessment according to their child’s age (ages 3-5).   
* Each assessment is 24 questions and will take parents \~ 5-7 minutes to complete.  
* Each Child’s Profile \= Skill Scores (6Cs+Literacy+Math) \+ Learning Preferences (Engagement \+ Modality \+ Social Level)

**Skills Measured**

The assessment measures the following skills:

* The 6Cs  
  * Collaboration  
  * Communication  
  * Content (content is scored by sum of literacy and math)  
  * Critical Thinking  
  * Creativity\&Curiosity  
  * Confidence  
* Academic Content Areas (counted towards ‘Content’ *and* each on its own)  
  * Literacy  
  * Math

**Skills Scoring Framework**

* Each skill (e.g., Each 6C, Literacy, Math) has **3 questions**.  
* Each question has 1 response worth **\+1 point** (strong alignment), 1 response worth **\+0.5 points** (partial alignment), and 2 responses worth **0 points**.  
* Maximum possible score per skill: **3 points** (3 questions × max 1 point each)  
* Scores considered when creating a child’s profile (archetype, strengths, growth areas) and what type of activities go in their personalized activity set.

## **Skill Distinctions (Ability Tiers)**

To categorize a child's ability or preference strength for a given skill, we use a tiered structure:

### 1\. Emerging/Key Growth Area (0–0.5 points)

The child shows little or no indication of this skill. Activities targeting this area should:

* Be lightly scaffolded.  
* Provide exposure to the skill without requiring mastery.  
* Focus on comfort and exploration.

### 2\. Developing/Growth Area (1–2 points)

The child shows a developing ability of this skill. Activities should:

* Reinforce the skill with gentle structure and repetition.  
* Offer choice and variation to increase motivation.  
* Encourage confidence-building through success.

### 3\. Strength Area (2.5–3 points)

The child shows consistent strength in this skill. Activities should:

* Allow for independent exploration or deeper challenge (challenge should be an activity tagged for one year older).  
* Use the skill as a primary learning pathway for new content.  
* Offer flexibility and leadership roles when possible.

**Preferences Measured**

* There are 4 questions that relate to the child’s preferences: how they prefer to engage with learning activities, how they learn new information (modality), their social preference, and their topic interests.  
    
* Learning Preferences  
  * Engagement   
    * Movement  
    * Pretend  
    * Hands-on   
    * Digital   
  * Modality (how they learn best)  
    * Independent (Hands-On)  
    * Visual (Observational)	  
    * Verbal (Step-by-Step)	  
    * Imaginative (Story/Play-based)  
  * Social Level  
    * Independent  
    * Parallel  
    * Cooperative  
    * Adult-Oriented  
* Topic Interests \- [Mamatha Chary](mailto:chary.mamathac@beginlearning.com)added last minute after our meeting 8/6, needs to be added throughout

The Learning Preferences impact personalized activity set recommendations (the learning and engagement modalities) parents are given and the archetype name and description. Eventually these will impact content personalization/surfacing on the AIO app. They do not impact strengths and growth areas. 

 Archetype, strengths description & areas for growth description should consider:

*  Total scores for:  
  * Collaboration  
  * Communication  
  * Content (=Literacy+Math)  
  * Critical Thinking  
  * Creativity\&Curiosity  
  * Confidence  
  * Literacy  
  * Math  
* Learning Preferences  
  * Engagement   
    * Movement  
    * Pretend  
    * Hands-on   
    * Digital   
  * Modality (how they learn best)  
    * Independent (Hands-On)  
    * Visual (Observational)	  
    * Verbal (Step-by-Step)	  
    * Imaginative (Story/Play-based)  
  * Social Level  
    * Independent  
    * Parallel  
    * Cooperative  
    * Adult-Oriented

Personalized activity set should consider:

* Growth areas for:  
  * Collaboration  
  * Communication  
  * Content (=Literacy+Math)  
  * Critical Thinking  
  * Creativity\&Curiosity  
  * Confidence  
  * Literacy  
  * Math  
* Learning Preferences  
  * Engagement   
    * Movement  
    * Pretend  
    * Hands-on   
    * Digital   
  * Modality (how they learn best)  
    * Independent (Hands-On)  
    * Visual (Observational)	  
    * Verbal (Step-by-Step)	  
    * Imaginative (Story/Play-based)  
  * Social Level  
    * Independent  
    * Parallel  
    * Cooperative  
    * Adult-Oriented  
  * Interests

**Personalized Activity Sets**

Personalized Activity Sets should include the following, all based around child’s profile (skills+learning preferences) and age:

The skill scores impact the content of the  personalized activity set parents are given and the archetype name and description. For example, if a child has a high literacy score, but a low math score, their profile should have more activities that are tagged with math than activities that are tagged with literacy. Similarly, if a child scores low on confidence, they should see activities that are tagged with confidence.

The personalized activity set is made up of:

* 5 printables   
* 2 blogs   
* 3 ideas for parents, everyday things to do   
* 3 project ideas with short descriptions for how-to 

Two Qs related to parenting style were added last min after meeting 8/6, the team needs to further discuss how we would like these to impact the activity set or other elements. [Mamatha Chary](mailto:chary.mamathac@beginlearning.com)

**Scoring**  
[*\*Link to rules & scoring spreadsheet*](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1K0OcVkhrX68CB_1zfXr7Oto9n5MCMVG6/edit?gid=569754788#gid=569754788)

## **1 .  From clicks to points**

*Every assessment has 24 multiple‑choice items – 3 per skill.* For each item parents choose one of four statements:

* **Strong skill** = +1 pt *Partial*\* = +0.5 pt *Not really*\* = 0 pt × 2 options.  
   That means each of the 8 skills can score **0 – 3** points.

## **2 .  Points to color bars (tiers)**

We translate the 0 – 3 totals into three simple tiers that parents instantly grasp:

| Tier label | Raw score | Colour in app | Activity philosophy |
| ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| **Strength** | 2.5 – 3 | Green | Stretch & extend |
| **Developing** | 1 – 2 | Yellow | Guided practice |
| **Emerging** | 0 – 0.5 | Orange | Exposure & support |

---

## **3 .  Eight color bars run through the 5‑gate “sorting hat”**

| Gate order | What we look for | Profile family created | Why that matters |
| ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| **1** | **≥ 4 green bars** | **A – Well‑Rounded High‑Flyer** | Child is already strong across many domains; needs to be challenged. |
| **2** | Any **2 of 3 language arts skills** (Creativity‑&‑Curiosity, Communication, Literacy) are green **AND** Math is **not** green **AND** total greens \< 4 | **B – Language & Creativity Lead** | Verbal and literacy play is the natural hook; math needs practice. |
| **3** | Math **OR** Critical‑Thinking is green **AND** Communication **not** green **AND** total greens \< 4 | **C – STEM / Logic Lead** | Analytical mindset first; communication needs support. |
| **4** | Collaboration **OR** Confidence is green **AND** total greens \< 4 | **D – Social / Confidence Lead** | People‑skills shine; harness group projects and self‑expression. |
| **5** | Everything else | **E – Emerging Explorer** | No standout yet; focus on exposure, practice repetition, and celebrate wins. |

Because we test gates **in order**, each score pattern triggers *one and only one* profile. The rebalanced rules spread the 6 561 possible skill‑grids more evenly: A =26 %, B =11 %, C= 26 %, D= 20 %, E= 18 %. (We validated this by brute‑forcing every combination in Python.)

*A profile code is simply the age band plus the family letter – e.g., a 3‑year‑old hitting Gate 2 becomes **3‑B “Story‑time Star.”***

---

## **4 .  Learning‑preference overlay**

Three extra questions tag the child’s favorite **Engagement** style (Movement, Pretend, Hands‑On, Digital), preferred **Modality** (Independent‑Hands‑On, Visual, Verbal, Imaginative) and **Social level** (Independent, Parallel, Cooperative, Adult‑Oriented). *These tags do **not** change which gate fires; they customize the activity set and text.*

---

## **5 .  Building the personalised activity set**

### **5.1 Tag engine**

Every activity in our library needs multi‑choice tags:

* **Skill focus** (e.g., Math, Confidence)

* **Age & Tier fit** (Emerging, Developing, Strength) – so one printable can appear as a *scaffold* for orange or as an *extension* for green.

* **Preference fit** (e.g., Movement + Cooperative)

During generation we run this query:

`SELECT activity_id`  
`FROM library`  
`WHERE skill_tag IN child.GrowthAreas   -- orange & yellow first`  
  `AND preference_tags ⊇ child.PreferenceTriple`  
`ORDER BY`  
   `CASE WHEN skill_tag IN child.Emerging THEN 1   -- highest need first`  
        `WHEN skill_tag IN child.Developing THEN 2`  
        `ELSE 3 END,`  
   `RAND()`  
`LIMIT 13;   -- 5 printables + 2 blogs + 3 ideas + 3 projects`

### **5.2 Assembly rules**

| Slot | Pull logic | Example you’ll see in a 4‑B set |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| **5 printables** | At least 3 must target orange/yellow skills; at least 2 must match preferred modality. | “Rhyme‑Wheel Spinner,” “Color‑Math Story Mats” |
| **2 blogs** | One matches top Emerging skill, one matches preference. | “Math Stories for Reluctant Counters” (Math Emerging) |
| **3 everyday ideas** | Hard‑coded text strings tied to profile letter. | “Pause halfway through a story and ask, ‘What happens next?’” |
| **3 projects** | All target at least one growth area; ≥ 1 must use child’s engagement style. | “Backyard Movie Studio” (Pretend \+ Cooperative) |

If the child is a **5‑C STEM Sleuth** with orange “Communication” and yellow “Confidence,” the engine might swap in a *picture‑label comic maker* (verbal plus confidence) and a *podcast interview project* (builds communication) ahead of more classic science experiments.

---

## **6 .  What each profile means to a parent**

*We translate the gate output into a friendly archetype so no one ever reads “low in math.”*

| Family | What we say to parents | Tone of recommended activities |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| **A** | “Whole‑brain thinker ready for stretch projects.” | Multi‑skill mash‑ups, leadership roles, advanced puzzles. |
| **B** | “Story‑lover whose words spark learning; let’s sprinkle in playful math.” | Narrative‑first printables, pretend‑shop money games, counting. |
| **C** | “Problem‑solver who experiments fearlessly; let’s grow language to match.” | Hands‑On experiments, data charts, communication coaching. |
| **D** | “Team‑builder who thrives with people; we’ll sneak academics into group play.” | Relay races for spelling, co‑operative board games, public‑speaking. |
| **E** | “Gentle explorer finding their groove; we’ll keep tasks small, safe and varied.” | Visual schedules, low‑stakes matching games, calming sensory projects. |

The *archetype nickname \+ color bars* help parents “see” their child and understand why certain printables appear.

---

## **Next Steps**

* Mamatha to edit archetype names and start copy for blurbs and parent summaries.  
* Mamatha to review and revise questions (while not changing format)  
  * Please pay special attention to the last two questions getting at parenting style, I added these last min (running out the door to the airport\!) after a team conversation about it. Check in with Sam and Timothy about these Qs as they likely have ideas. We also need to discuss how the responses are informing the output.  
* Mamatha to connect with Cara re: focus group feedback on any additional questions that should be added for a teacher-facing version.  
* \*\*\* (priority) Mamatha to create database with current resources (printables & blogs) and tag resources with:  
  * Age  
  * Skill(s) Targeted: Collaboration, Communication, Content, Critical Thinking, Creativity\&Curiosity, Confidence, Literacy, Math  
  * Learning Preferences (including interests) \- give each option a unique tag  
* Mamatha to start creating and add to database (use ChatGPT and edit):   
  * 3 ideas for parents, prompts for every day things parents can do (e.g., ““Count how many stairs aloud together each time you go up and down.”)  
    * There should be 1 example per age and skill and age and response for Q43 (learning preference, engagement)  
  * 3 project ideas with short descriptions for how-to (e.g., “Cardboard City Build – Save small boxes for a week, tape roads to the floor, then design a mini city together, labeling each building and counting windows as you go.”)  
    * There should be 1 example per age and skill and age and response for Q43 (learning preference, engagement)  
  * Add these to the database with tagged printables & blogs and tag  
* Timothy to work with web and dev on how to make this happen from the dev side.
