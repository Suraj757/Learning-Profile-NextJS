# Assessment Link Flow - Debug Guide

## Expected Behavior

When a teacher creates an assessment link on `/teacher/send-assessment`, here's what should happen:

### 1. Teacher Creates Link
- Teacher fills out form with student name, parent email
- System generates unique assignment token (e.g., `nl1zlfhgm72fuf72v498q`)
- Link format: `https://domain.com/assessment/start?ref=TOKEN&source=teacher`

### 2. Parent Clicks Link
- **Should work without any authentication**
- Page loads with teacher-specific messaging
- Shows "Your teacher sent you this assessment..." message
- Parent fills in child's name and grade
- Proceeds to assessment questions

### 3. Assessment Completion
- Parent answers 24 questions
- Results are generated
- Assignment is marked as completed in teacher's dashboard

## Current Issue

ðŸš¨ **PROBLEM**: Assessment links are redirecting to Vercel login screen

## Possible Causes

### 1. Vercel Preview Deployment Protection
```bash
# Check if this is a preview deployment
# Preview deployments sometimes have password protection
URL: https://learning-profile-next-f5y46s1n2-suraj-7044s-projects.vercel.app/
```

### 2. Branch Protection
```bash
# Check if deployment is from protected branch
# Some branches may have authentication requirements
```

### 3. Environment Variables Missing
```bash
# Check if required env vars are set in Vercel
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=?
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=?
```

### 4. Vercel Project Settings
```bash
# Check Vercel dashboard settings:
- Authentication & Protection
- Preview Deployments settings
- Domain configuration
```

## Debugging Steps

### Step 1: Check Deployment Type
1. Go to Vercel dashboard
2. Check if this is a preview deployment vs production
3. Look for any authentication settings

### Step 2: Test Production Domain
If you have a production domain (non-preview), test:
```
https://your-production-domain.com/assessment/start?ref=test123&source=teacher
```

### Step 3: Check Environment Variables
In Vercel dashboard:
1. Go to Project Settings
2. Check Environment Variables tab
3. Ensure Supabase vars are set for all environments

### Step 4: Disable Preview Protection
In Vercel dashboard:
1. Go to Project Settings
2. Find "Git" or "Authentication" section
3. Disable password protection for preview deployments

## Quick Fix

If this is a preview deployment with protection:

1. **Option A**: Deploy to production branch
2. **Option B**: Disable preview protection in Vercel settings
3. **Option C**: Use custom domain without protection

## Testing Assessment Flow

Once fixed, test this exact flow:

1. **Teacher side**:
   - Go to `/teacher/send-assessment`
   - Create link for "Test Child" with your email
   - Copy the generated link

2. **Parent side** (different browser/incognito):
   - Open the assessment link
   - Should see teacher-specific message
   - Fill in child name and grade
   - Start assessment

3. **Expected result**:
   - No authentication required
   - Smooth flow from link to assessment
   - Results appear in teacher dashboard

## Status: CRITICAL BUG ðŸš¨

Parents cannot access assessments, breaking the core teacher-parent workflow.
