Dear [Teacher's Name],

I'm excited for ${childName} to be in your ${grade} class this year! I recently completed a learning profile assessment and discovered that ${childName} is a "${personalityLabel}" learner.

Here are the key insights that might help you connect with ${childName}:

🌟 STRONGEST AREA: ${topStrength}
${childName} thrives when they can ${topStrength === 'Communication' ? 'share ideas verbally, explain their thinking, and engage in discussions' : topStrength === 'Creative Innovation' ? 'express creativity, try new approaches, and think outside the box' : topStrength === 'Collaboration' ? 'work with others, contribute to team efforts, and help classmates' : topStrength === 'Critical Thinking' ? 'analyze problems, ask questions, and explore how things work' : topStrength === 'Content' ? 'connect learning to their interests and see real-world applications' : 'build confidence through achievable challenges and positive reinforcement'}.

📈 DEVELOPING AREA: ${developingArea}
${childName} is working on ${developingArea.toLowerCase()} skills. At home, we're supporting this by [you can add specific examples].

❓ Questions for our first meeting:
• How do you typically support ${personalityLabel.toLowerCase()} learners in your classroom?
• What classroom accommodations might help ${childName} shine?
• How can I reinforce your classroom strategies at home?
• When would be a good time to check in on ${childName}'s progress?

I'm committed to partnering with you to make this ${childName}'s best school year yet!

Best regards,
[Your Name]
[Your Phone] | [Your Email]

P.S. I'm happy to share the full learning profile report if you'd find it helpful!`,
