# Data Policy and Privacy Framework

## Overview

The Begin Learning Profile platform is designed with privacy-first principles and strict compliance with educational data protection regulations. This document outlines our data handling practices, user rights, and technical safeguards.

## Regulatory Compliance

### FERPA (Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act)

**Educational Records Protection**:
- All student learning profiles are treated as education records under FERPA
