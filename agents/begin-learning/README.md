# Begin Learning Profile Agents

This directory contains specialized agents for the Begin Learning Profile assessment and personalization system. These agents work together to transform 24-question assessments into meaningful child development insights and personalized learning experiences.

## Agent Overview

### Core Processing Agents
- **assessment-scoring-engine** - Automates the 24-question → 8-skill scores → archetype assignment
- **activity-matching-agent** - Curates personalized activity sets (5 printables + 2 blogs + 3 ideas + 3 projects)
- **profile-narrative-generator** - Creates warm, celebratory archetype descriptions

### Supporting Infrastructure Agents
- **content-tagging-agent** - Scales activity library with consistent skill/preference tagging
- **profile-validation-agent** - Quality control preventing incorrect profiles from reaching parents
- **parent-communication-assistant** - Helps create conference materials and family guidance

## Deployment Sequence

### Phase 1: Core System (Week 1-2)
1. Deploy `assessment-scoring-engine` first - this is your foundation
2. Add `profile-narrative-generator` for immediate parent value
3. Test with sample assessments to validate accuracy

### Phase 2: Personalization (Week 3-4)
1. Deploy `content-tagging-agent` to organize activity library
2. Add `activity-matching-agent` for personalized recommendations
3. Begin A/B testing activity relevance and completion

### Phase 3: Quality & Scale (Week 5-6)
1. Deploy `profile-validation-agent` for automated quality control
2. Add `parent-communication-assistant` for teacher support
3. Full system integration and optimization

## Integration with Existing Agents

These agents work best when combined with your existing studio agents:

- **ai-engineer** → Implement scoring logic and recommendation algorithms
- **rapid-prototyper** → Build interfaces for profile display and activity delivery
- **test-writer-fixer** → Ensure complex scoring system reliability
- **feedback-synthesizer** → Analyze parent feedback on profile accuracy
- **analytics-reporter** → Track profile engagement and activity completion

## Success Metrics

- **Accuracy**: >95% parent agreement with profile descriptions
- **Engagement**: >4.5/5 parent satisfaction with activities
- **Efficiency**: <500ms assessment processing time
- **Quality**: <2% profiles requiring human review
- **Scale**: 10x increase in content tagging speed

## Quick Start

1. Copy all agent files to your `~/.claude/agents/begin-learning/` directory
2. Restart Claude Code to load the new agents
3. Test with: "Process this sample assessment data using the Begin Learning Profile system"
4. The agents will automatically coordinate to handle the complete workflow

For detailed implementation guides and examples, see each agent's individual documentation.
