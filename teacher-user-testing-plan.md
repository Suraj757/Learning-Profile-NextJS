## Facilitator Guidelines

### Do's
- **Encourage thinking aloud** throughout all tasks
- **Ask follow-up questions** when participants pause or hesitate
- **Remain neutral** - avoid leading questions or defending the design
- **Probe for specific examples** when participants give general feedback
- **Thank participants** genuinely for their time and expertise

### Don'ts
- **Don't explain how features work** unless absolutely necessary
- **Don't interrupt** natural exploration and discovery
- **Don't take feedback personally** or get defensive about design choices
- **Don't rush participants** through tasks - let natural pace emerge
- **Don't assume understanding** - ask for clarification of feedback

### Emergency Protocols
- **Technical Issues:** Have backup screen-sharing ready, phone numbers for participants
- **Time Overruns:** Prioritize Task 3 (Results Review) if other tasks run long
- **Participant Confusion:** Provide minimal guidance to complete task, note for later analysis
- **System Crashes:** Switch to static screenshots/mockups if needed

This comprehensive testing plan will provide actionable insights into teacher adoption, usability challenges, and the real-world educational value of the enhanced Learning Profile application.
