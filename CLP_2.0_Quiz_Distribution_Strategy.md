# CLP 2.0 Quiz Distribution Strategy

## Executive Summary

This document outlines the complete transformation of our current ~26-question assessment system into a CLP 2.0 compliant dual-quiz architecture supporting both parent and teacher assessments while maintaining 24-question compliance and enabling progressive profile building.

## Current System Analysis

### Existing Question Structure (Per Age Group)
- **Age 3-4**: 26 questions (15 6Cs + 6 Content + 3 Preferences + 2 Experience)
- **Age 4-5**: 26 questions (same structure as 3-4)
- **Age 5+**: 29 questions (24 6Cs + 5 other)

### Current Scoring System
- **Ages 3-4, 4-5**: Multiple choice with weighted scoring (1-5 scale)
- **Age 5+**: Likert scale (1-5)

## CLP 2.0 Compliance Requirements

### Core Structure
- **Exactly 24 questions** across all age groups
- **8 skills measured**: 6Cs + Literacy + Math (3 questions each)
- **New scoring system**: 1 point (strong), 0.5 point (partial), 0 point (none)
- **Plus 4 preference questions**: Engagement, Modality, Social Level, Interests

### Skills Distribution (24 Questions)
1. **Collaboration** (3 questions)
2. **Communication** (3 questions)
3. **Critical Thinking** (3 questions)
4. **Creativity & Curiosity** (3 questions)
5. **Confidence** (3 questions)
6. **Literacy** (3 questions) - contributes to Content + standalone
7. **Math** (3 questions) - contributes to Content + standalone
8. **Content** = Literacy + Math combined score

### Preference Questions (4 Additional)
1. **Engagement Style** (Movement, Pretend, Hands-on, Digital)
2. **Learning Modality** (Independent, Visual, Verbal, Imaginative)
3. **Social Level** (Independent, Parallel, Cooperative, Adult-Oriented)
4. **Topic Interests** (Multi-select from predefined list)

## Quiz Architecture Redesign

### 1. Question Restructuring Strategy

#### Current to CLP 2.0 Mapping
```
Current (26 questions) → CLP 2.0 (24 questions)

6Cs Questions (15) → Reduce to 15 (3 each for 5 skills)
Content Questions (6) → Split into Literacy (3) + Math (3) = 6
Preferences (3) → Expand to 4 standardized preference questions
Experience/Other (2) → Remove or integrate into teacher-specific questions
```

#### Question Selection Criteria
- **Retain**: Highest-performing questions with best discrimination
- **Modify**: Questions that need slight adjustments for dual context
- **Remove**: Redundant or poorly-performing questions
- **Add**: New questions to reach exactly 3 per skill

### 2. Parent vs Teacher Quiz Distribution

#### Parent Quiz (18-20 questions)
**Focus**: Home behavior and family context

**Question Distribution**:
- Collaboration (2-3 questions): Family/sibling interactions
- Communication (2-3 questions): Home expression and sharing
- Critical Thinking (2-3 questions): Problem-solving at home
- Creativity & Curiosity (2-3 questions): Home exploration and creativity
- Confidence (2-3 questions): Independence and self-assurance at home
- Literacy (2-3 questions): Reading engagement at home
- Math (2-3 questions): Number concepts in daily life
- All 4 preference questions

**Sample Parent-Focused Questions**:
```
Collaboration: "While you're making dinner, they're most likely to:"
Communication: "When you ask 'What did you do today?' they're most likely to:"
Literacy: "When we read books together, they're most likely to:"
Math: "When you ask them to count toys, they're most likely to:"
```

#### Teacher Quiz (15-18 questions)
**Focus**: Classroom behavior and academic context

**Question Distribution**:
- Collaboration (2-3 questions): Peer interactions and teamwork
- Communication (2-3 questions): Classroom participation
- Critical Thinking (2-3 questions): Academic problem-solving
- Creativity & Curiosity (2-3 questions): Learning exploration
- Confidence (2-3 questions): Academic confidence
- Literacy (2-3 questions): Reading skills in academic setting
- Math (2-3 questions): Mathematical thinking in classroom
- Interests question only (shared component)

**Teacher-Specific Questions** (Last 4-5 questions):
```
"During group activities, this child typically:"
"When facing academic challenges, this child:"
"In classroom discussions, this child:"
"During independent work time, this child:"
"This child's approach to new academic concepts is:"
```

#### Overlap Strategy
**Shared Questions** (8-10 questions):
- Universal behavioral indicators that apply in both contexts
- Interest question (identical for all respondents)
- Core skill demonstrations that transcend setting

**Context-Specific Questions**:
- Parent: Home routines, family interactions, informal learning
- Teacher: Classroom dynamics, academic performance, peer interactions

## 3. Age-Based Question Selection Algorithm

### Dynamic Question Selection Logic
```typescript
interface QuestionSelectionCriteria {
  ageGroup: '3-4' | '4-5' | '5+'
  respondentType: 'parent' | 'teacher'
  skillFocus: string[]
  developmentalLevel: 'emerging' | 'developing' | 'advanced'
}

function selectQuestions(criteria: QuestionSelectionCriteria): Question[] {
  // 1. Select age-appropriate base questions (24 total)
  // 2. Filter by respondent context (parent/teacher)
  // 3. Ensure 3 questions per skill
  // 4. Add 4 preference questions
  // 5. Validate total count = 28 (24 skills + 4 preferences)
}
```

### Age-Specific Adaptations

#### Ages 3-4
- **Language**: Simple, concrete scenarios
- **Context**: Basic daily routines and play
- **Scoring**: Developmental milestones focus

#### Ages 4-5
- **Language**: More complex scenarios
- **Context**: Pre-K activities and social situations
- **Scoring**: School readiness indicators

#### Ages 5+
- **Language**: Academic and social complexity
- **Context**: School-based scenarios
- **Scoring**: Academic and social-emotional competencies

## 4. Scoring System Migration

### Current to CLP 2.0 Scoring Conversion

#### Current System (1-5 Scale)
```
1-2: Low performance
3: Moderate performance  
4-5: High performance
```

#### CLP 2.0 System (0-3 Point Scale)
```
3 points: Strong alignment (top response option)
1.5 points: Partial alignment (second response option)  
0 points: No alignment (bottom two response options)
```

#### Conversion Algorithm
```typescript
function convertToCLP2Scoring(currentResponse: number): number {
  // Map 1-5 scale to 0-3 point system
  switch(currentResponse) {
    case 5: return 1.0  // Strong
    case 4: return 0.5  // Partial
    case 3: return 0.5  // Partial
    case 2: return 0.0  // None
    case 1: return 0.0  // None
    default: return 0.0
  }
}
```

### Skill Tier Classifications
```
Strength: 2.5-3.0 points (Green bar)
Developing: 1.0-2.0 points (Yellow bar)
Emerging: 0.0-0.5 points (Orange bar)
```

## 5. Progressive Profile Building

### Multi-Respondent Data Integration

#### Weighted Scoring Strategy
```typescript
interface ProfileData {
  parentResponses: Responses
  teacherResponses?: Responses
  finalScores: SkillScores
  confidence: number
}

function buildProgressiveProfile(data: ProfileData): LearningProfile {
  // 1. Calculate individual scores from each respondent
  // 2. Apply weighting based on question context relevance
  // 3. Generate composite scores with confidence intervals
  // 4. Determine archetype using 5-gate system
  // 5. Create unified learning preferences
}
```

#### Weighting Logic
- **Home questions**: 100% parent weight
- **School questions**: 100% teacher weight (when available)
- **Universal questions**: Averaged between respondents
- **Conflict resolution**: Flag significant discrepancies for review

### Data Quality Assurance
```typescript
interface DataQuality {
  completeness: number
  consistency: number
  reliability: number
  confidence: number
}

function assessDataQuality(responses: MultiRespondentData): DataQuality {
  // 1. Check response completeness
  // 2. Measure inter-respondent agreement
  // 3. Identify unusual response patterns
  // 4. Calculate overall confidence score
}
```
