### CLP 2.0 Profiles Table
```sql

### Responses Table

```

## Scoring Algorithm Implementation

### CLP 2.0 Scoring Engine
```javascript
class CLP2ScoringEngine {
  
  calculateSkillScore(responses, skillQuestions) {
    const scores = skillQuestions.map(qId => responses[qId] || 0);
    const totalPoints = scores.reduce((sum, score) => sum + score, 0);
    const maxPoints = skillQuestions.length * 1.0; // Max 1.0 per question
    return totalPoints / maxPoints; // Returns 0.0 to 1.0
  }
  
  generateProfile(responses, childData) {
    const skillScores = {
      communication: this.calculateSkillScore(responses, [1, 2, 3]),
      collaboration: this.calculateSkillScore(responses, [4, 5, 6]),
      content: this.calculateSkillScore(responses, [7, 8, 9]),
      criticalThinking: this.calculateSkillScore(responses, [10, 11, 12]),
      creativeInnovation: this.calculateSkillScore(responses, [13, 14, 15]),
      confidence: this.calculateSkillScore(responses, [16, 17, 18]),
      socialEmotional: this.calculateSkillScore(responses, [19, 20, 21]),
      physicalDevelopment: this.calculateSkillScore(responses, [22, 23, 24])
    };
    
    return {
      scores: skillScores,
      archetype: this.determineArchetype(skillScores),
      strengths: this.identifyStrengths(skillScores),
      developing: this.identifyDeveloping(skillScores),
      recommendations: this.generateRecommendations(skillScores, childData)
    };
  }
  
  determineArchetype(scores) {
    const topSkills = Object.entries(scores)
      .sort(([,a], [,b]) => b - a)
      .slice(0, 2)
      .map(([skill]) => skill);
      
    const archetypeMap = {
      ['communication', 'creativeInnovation']: 'Creative Communicator',
      ['criticalThinking', 'content']: 'Analytical Scholar', 
      ['collaboration', 'socialEmotional']: 'Social Connector',
      ['confidence', 'physicalDevelopment']: 'Confident Explorer'
      // ... more combinations
    };
    
    return archetypeMap[topSkills.join(',')] || 'Unique Learner';
  }
}
```

## Activity Recommendation Engine

### Personalized Activity Generator
```javascript
class ActivityRecommendationEngine {
  
  generateActivities(profile, preferences) {
    const activities = [];
    
    // Combine strengths with interests
    const strengthBasedActivities = this.combineStrengthsWithInterests(
      profile.strengths, 
      preferences.interests
    );
    
    // Target developing skills
    const developmentalActivities = this.targetDevelopingSkills(
      profile.developing,
      preferences.learningStyle
    );
    
    // Age-appropriate formatting
    const ageAppropriateActivities = this.formatForAge(
      [...strengthBasedActivities, ...developmentalActivities],
      profile.ageGroup
    );
    
    return ageAppropriateActivities.slice(0, 8); // Top 8 recommendations
  }
  
  combineStrengthsWithInterests(strengths, interests) {
    const activityMatrix = {
      'communication + animals': {
        title: 'Animal Story Theater',
        description: 'Create and perform stories about favorite animals',
        skills: ['Communication', 'Creative Innovation'],
        materials: ['Animal figures', 'Props', 'Recording device'],
        duration: '20-30 minutes'
      },
      'criticalThinking + building': {
        title: 'Engineering Challenges',
        description: 'Build structures to solve specific problems',
        skills: ['Critical Thinking', 'Physical Development'],
        materials: ['Blocks', 'Challenge cards', 'Measuring tools'],
        duration: '30-45 minutes'
      }
      // ... extensive activity matrix
    };
    
    return strengths.flatMap(strength => 
      interests.map(interest => 
        activityMatrix[`${strength} + ${interest}`]
      ).filter(Boolean)
    );
  }
}
```
