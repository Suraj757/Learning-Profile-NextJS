# Multi-Quiz Consolidation System Testing

This document outlines comprehensive testing for the multi-quiz consolidation system that handles Parent + Teacher assessments with progressive profile building.

## üéØ Test Coverage Overview

The testing suite validates 8 critical areas:

1. **Parent + Teacher Consolidation Logic**
2. **Confidence Weighting Algorithms** 
3. **Progressive Profile Building Over Time**
4. **Skill Score Merging and Averaging**
5. **Conflict Resolution for Differing Scores**
6. **Progressive Profile API Endpoints**
7. **Database Operations**
8. **Incomplete Assessment Handling**

## üß™ Test Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Aligned Assessments
Tests when parent and teacher observations align closely, resulting in high confidence consolidated profiles.

**Expected Outcomes:**
- Confidence ‚â• 85%
- Completeness ‚â• 90%
- Consistent strength identification
- High-quality recommendations

### Scenario 2: Conflicting Assessments  
Tests handling of significant differences between home and school behavior.

**Expected Outcomes:**
- Confidence ‚â§ 70% (flagged for review)
- Context-differential indicators
- Specialized recommendations
- Professional intervention suggestions

### Scenario 3: Progressive Building
Tests profile development over academic year with multiple assessment points.

**Expected Outcomes:**
- Increasing confidence with quality data
- Growth tracking over time
- Developmental milestone detection
- Diminishing returns for repeated assessments

### Scenario 4: Incomplete Data
Tests handling of partial assessments and collaborative completion.

**Expected Outcomes:**
- Graceful degradation with incomplete data
- Appropriate confidence penalties
- Clear warnings to users
- Successful consolidation of partial data

## üé® Test Data Patterns

### High-Performing Child (Aligned)
```javascript
const alignedHighPerformer = {
  parent: { Communication: 5, Collaboration: 5, Creative: 5 },
  teacher: { Communication: 4, Collaboration: 4, Academic: 4 },
  expected: { confidence: 85, personality: "Creative Collaborator" }
}
```

### Support-Needed Child (Conflicting)
```javascript
const conflictingSupport = {
  parent: { Creative: 5, Confidence: 4 }, // Strong at home
  teacher: { Communication: 2, Academic: 2 }, // Struggles in school
  expected: { confidence: 60, flags: ["home_school_differential"] }
}
```

### Progressive Development
```javascript
const progressiveGrowth = [
  { month: 1, Math: 2.0, Literacy: 2.5 },
  { month: 3, Math: 2.5, Literacy: 3.0 },
  { month: 6, Math: 3.0, Literacy: 4.0 }  // Clear growth pattern
]
```

## ‚öñÔ∏è Validation Criteria

### Confidence Calculation
- **High (80%+)**: Aligned assessments, professional input, complete data
- **Medium (60-79%)**: Some conflicts, mostly complete data
- **Low (<60%)**: Significant conflicts, incomplete data, flags needed

### Consolidation Quality
- **Excellent**: Multiple sources, high agreement, developmental appropriateness
- **Good**: Some disagreement, mostly complete, contextually aware
- **Concerning**: Major conflicts, incomplete, requires intervention

### Performance Standards
- API response time: < 2 seconds
- Concurrent handling: 10+ simultaneous requests
- Database consistency: 100% accuracy
- Memory efficiency: No leaks or excessive usage

## üîß Test Configuration

### Jest Configuration
```json
{
  "testEnvironment": "node",
  "testTimeout": 30000,
  "setupFilesAfterEnv": ["<rootDir>/tests/setup.js"],
  "collectCoverageFrom": [
    "src/lib/**/*.{js,ts}",
    "src/app/api/**/*.{js,ts}"
  ]
}
```

### Environment Variables
```bash
# Required for testing
NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_URL=http://localhost:3000
NODE_ENV=test

SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_test_key
```

## üìù Manual Testing Scenarios

### Parent-Teacher Alignment Test
1. Parent completes home assessment (high creativity scores)
2. Teacher completes classroom assessment (confirms creativity)
3. **Verify**: Consolidated profile shows "Creative" strengths
4. **Check**: Confidence 80%+, consistent recommendations

### Home-School Differential Test
1. Parent rates child as confident and communicative
2. Teacher rates same child as shy and reserved
3. **Verify**: System flags differential appropriately
4. **Check**: Lower confidence, context-specific recommendations

### Progressive Development Test
1. Initial parent assessment (September)
2. Teacher assessment added (October) 
3. Parent retake showing growth (January)
4. **Verify**: Growth indicators, increasing confidence
5. **Check**: Developmental appropriateness

## üö® Error Scenarios to Test

2. **API Timing**: Increase timeout for slow operations
3. **Mock Data**: Verify test data reflects real scenarios
4. **Environment**: Check all required env vars are set

### Debug Commands

# Run with debug output
DEBUG=* npm run test:consolidation

# Single test with verbose logging
