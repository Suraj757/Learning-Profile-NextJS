**Goal: Stop active data exposure**

**Immediate Actions:**
1. **Deploy Emergency Middleware**
   - Block all unauthenticated access to `/results/*`
   - Add temporary authentication gate
   - Implement basic session validation

2. **Secure Existing Data** 
   - Enable database encryption for sensitive fields
   - Remove predictable profile IDs
   - Add access logging

3. **Communication Plan**
   - Notify existing users of security maintenance
   - Prepare educational communication about new security

**Deliverables:**
- Emergency authentication middleware
- Database security patches
- User communication templates

---

### **PHASE 1: AUTHENTICATION FOUNDATION (Week 1)**
**Goal: Secure user authentication and basic authorization**

**Core Components:**
1. **Multi-Stakeholder Authentication System**
   ```typescript
   // User Types with Educational Context
   interface TeacherUser {
     id: string
     email: string
     schoolId: string
     classrooms: string[]
     permissions: TeacherPermissions
   }
   
   interface ParentUser {
     id: string
     email: string
     children: ChildRelationship[]
     consentStatus: ConsentRecord[]
   }
   ```

2. **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**
   - **Teachers**: Access only assigned classroom students
   - **Parents**: Access only their own children's data
   - **School Admins**: Controlled access within district
   - **Students** (age 13+): Access own data with parental oversight

3. **Secure Session Management**
   - JWT tokens with educational context
   - Multi-factor authentication for sensitive operations
   - Session timeout and suspicious activity detection

**Technical Implementation:**
- Replace localStorage auth with secure JWT system
- Implement educational relationship verification
- Add permission middleware to all routes

**COPPA Compliance (Children Under 13):**
1. **Parental Consent System**
   - Verified parental consent before any data collection
   - Granular consent by data category
   - Consent renewal and withdrawal mechanisms

2. **Enhanced Data Protections**
   - No behavioral tracking cookies

     action: 'view' | 'edit' | 'export' | 'share'
     educationalPurpose: string
     dataAccessed: string[]
     ipAddress: string
   }
   ```

**Privacy Controls Interface:**
1. **Parent Privacy Dashboard**

   - Protect individual privacy while preserving insights
   - K-anonymity for all reporting

2. **Data Minimization**
   - Collect only educationally necessary data
   - Automatic data classification by sensitivity
   - Purpose-limited data retention

---

### **PHASE 4: DATA GOVERNANCE & RETENTION (Week 5)**
**Goal: Automated compliance and data lifecycle management**

**Automated Data Retention:**
1. **Granular Retention Policies**
   ```typescript
   interface RetentionPolicy {
     dataType: 'assessment' | 'profile' | 'audit_log'
     retentionPeriod: number // days
     studentAge: 'under_13' | '13_16' | 'over_16'
     state?: string // for state-specific requirements
     autoDelete: boolean
   }
   ```

2. **Parent Notification System**
   - 30-day advance notice before data deletion
   - Annual privacy review reminders
   - Consent renewal notifications

**Data Portability & Rights:**
1. **Export Functionality**
   - Complete data export in portable format
   - Educational records in FERPA-compliant format

  session_token TEXT ENCRYPTED,
  expires_at TIMESTAMP,
  created_at TIMESTAMP,
  last_accessed TIMESTAMP,
  ip_address TEXT,
  user_agent TEXT
);

CREATE TABLE educational_relationships (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  adult_user_id UUID NOT NULL, -- teacher or parent
  student_id UUID NOT NULL,

);

-- Enable Row Level Security
ALTER TABLE student_profiles ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- Teachers can only access students in their classrooms
CREATE POLICY teacher_student_access ON student_profiles
  FOR ALL TO teachers
  USING (
    EXISTS (
      SELECT 1 FROM educational_relationships 
      WHERE adult_user_id = auth.uid() 
      AND student_id = student_profiles.id
      AND relationship_type = 'teacher'
    )
  );
```

### **Authentication Middleware**
```typescript
// /src/middleware.ts
export async function middleware(request: NextRequest) {
  // Protect all student data routes
  if (request.nextUrl.pathname.startsWith('/results/')) {
    const token = request.cookies.get('auth-token')?.value
    
    if (!token) {
      return NextResponse.redirect(new URL('/auth/login', request.url))
    }
    
    const user = await validateEducationalAccess(token, request.nextUrl.pathname)
    if (!user) {
      return NextResponse.redirect(new URL('/auth/unauthorized', request.url))
    }
    
    // Log educational data access
    await logEducationalAccess(user, request.nextUrl.pathname)
  }
  
  return NextResponse.next()
}
```
