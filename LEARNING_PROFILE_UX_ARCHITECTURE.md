## 2. Technical Architecture Design

### Core Challenge
Create a single dynamic child profile system that adapts to different input contexts (parent direct vs. teacher-referred) while maintaining consistency and avoiding duplicate profiles.

### Proposed Architecture

#### Database Schema Enhancements

```sql
-- Enhanced profiles table
ALTER TABLE profiles ADD COLUMN source_context VARCHAR(20) DEFAULT 'parent_direct';
ALTER TABLE profiles ADD COLUMN referring_teacher_id INTEGER REFERENCES teachers(id);
ALTER TABLE profiles ADD COLUMN question_set_version VARCHAR(10) DEFAULT 'v1_unified';
ALTER TABLE profiles ADD COLUMN context_metadata JSONB DEFAULT '{}';

-- New question sets table
CREATE TABLE question_sets (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  version VARCHAR(10) NOT NULL,
  context_type VARCHAR(20) NOT NULL, -- 'parent_direct', 'teacher_referred', 'universal'
  questions JSONB NOT NULL,
  scoring_weights JSONB NOT NULL,
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);

-- Enhanced profile assignments
ALTER TABLE profile_assignments ADD COLUMN question_set_id INTEGER REFERENCES question_sets(id);
ALTER TABLE profile_assignments ADD COLUMN parent_context JSONB DEFAULT '{}';
```

#### Question System Architecture

```typescript
// Core types for flexible question system
interface QuestionSet {
  id: number
  version: string
  contextType: 'parent_direct' | 'teacher_referred' | 'universal'
  questions: Question[]
  scoringWeights: Record<string, number>
}

interface Question {
  id: number
  text: string
  contextVariants?: {
    parent_direct?: string
    teacher_referred?: string
  }
  responseType: 'likert5' | 'multipleChoice' | 'slider'
  scoringDimensions: string[]
}

interface ProfileContext {
  source: 'parent_direct' | 'teacher_referred'
  referringTeacherId?: number
  questionSetId: number
  metadata: {
    invitationMessage?: string
    teacherName?: string
    schoolName?: string
  }
}
```

#### Dynamic Profile Generation System

```typescript
class DynamicProfileGenerator {
  generateProfile(
    responses: Record<number, number>,
    context: ProfileContext,
    childInfo: ChildInfo
  ): LearningProfile {
    
    // 1. Load appropriate question set and scoring weights
    const questionSet = this.loadQuestionSet(context.questionSetId)
    
    // 2. Calculate scores with context-aware weighting
    const scores = this.calculateScores(responses, questionSet, context)
    
    // 3. Generate personality label with context consideration
    const personalityLabel = this.generatePersonalityLabel(scores, context)
    
    // 4. Create context-appropriate description
    const description = this.generateDescription(scores, personalityLabel, context)
    
    // 5. Generate context-specific recommendations
    const recommendations = this.generateRecommendations(scores, context)
    
    return {
      ...childInfo,
      scores,
      personalityLabel,
      description,
      recommendations,
      sourceContext: context.source,
      referringTeacherId: context.referringTeacherId,
      questionSetVersion: questionSet.version
    }
  }
  
  private calculateScores(
    responses: Record<number, number>,
    questionSet: QuestionSet,
    context: ProfileContext
  ): Record<string, number> {
    // Apply context-specific scoring weights
    const baseScores = this.calculateBaseScores(responses, questionSet)
    
    // Adjust for context
    if (context.source === 'teacher_referred') {
      return this.applyTeacherContextWeights(baseScores)
    }
    
    return this.applyParentContextWeights(baseScores)
  }
}
```

#### Question Context System

```typescript
// Example of context-adaptive questions
const adaptiveQuestions: Question[] = [
  {
    id: 1,
    text: "When facing a challenging task, this child typically...",
    contextVariants: {
      parent_direct: "When your child faces a challenging task at home (like a puzzle or homework), they typically...",
      teacher_referred: "When your child faces a challenging task in school settings, you've noticed they typically..."
    },
    responseType: 'likert5',
    scoringDimensions: ['persistence', 'help_seeking']
  },
  {
    id: 2,
    text: "In social situations, this child...",
    contextVariants: {
      parent_direct: "During family gatherings or playdates, your child...",
      teacher_referred: "In classroom group activities, you've observed your child..."
    },
    responseType: 'likert5',
    scoringDimensions: ['social_confidence', 'collaboration']
  }
]
```

### Input/Output Flexibility Architecture

#### Unified Assessment API

```typescript
// API endpoint that handles both contexts
POST /api/assessment/start
{
  childName: string
  age: string
  grade?: string
  context: {
    source: 'parent_direct' | 'teacher_referred'
    assignmentToken?: string
    referringTeacherId?: number
  }
}

// Response includes appropriate question set
{
  sessionId: string
  questionSet: Question[]
  context: ProfileContext
  totalQuestions: number
}
```

#### Context-Aware Question Delivery

```typescript
class ContextAwareQuestionService {
  getNextQuestion(
    sessionId: string, 
    currentQuestionIndex: number
  ): Question {
    const session = this.getSession(sessionId)
    const baseQuestion = session.questionSet[currentQuestionIndex]
    
    // Return context-appropriate question text
    return {
      ...baseQuestion,
      text: this.getContextualQuestionText(baseQuestion, session.context)
    }
  }
  
  private getContextualQuestionText(
    question: Question, 
    context: ProfileContext
  ): string {
    const variant = question.contextVariants?.[context.source]
    return variant || question.text
  }
}
```

### Profile Consistency System

```typescript
interface ProfileConsistencyManager {
  // Ensure profile elements remain consistent across contexts
  normalizeProfile(profile: LearningProfile): LearningProfile
  
  // Map between different context outputs
  adaptProfileForSharing(
    profile: LearningProfile, 
    targetAudience: 'teacher' | 'parent' | 'mixed'
  ): LearningProfile
  
  // Validate cross-context consistency
  validateProfileCoherence(profile: LearningProfile): ValidationResult
}
```

## Conclusion

This comprehensive architecture enables the Learning Profile platform to serve three distinct user flows while maintaining profile consistency and quality. The flexible question system and dynamic profile generation ensure that parents and teachers receive contextually relevant experiences while producing compatible, shareable results.

The implementation roadmap prioritizes backward compatibility and incremental enhancement, allowing for rapid deployment and iteration based on real user feedback. By focusing on the core user needs in each context while maintaining universal profile standards, the platform can become an essential bridge between home and school learning environments.

The proposed architecture supports sustainable growth through clear separation of concerns, scalable data structures, and comprehensive analytics capabilities that inform ongoing product development and user experience optimization.
